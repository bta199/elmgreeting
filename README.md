# Elm Greeting

This is a demo I made while learning more about https://elm-lang.org/.

See https://bta199.github.io/elmgreeting/ to give it a try!

## Build

First install Elm by following this guide https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html.

To build execute the following in a console at the repository root folder;

```elm make src/Main.elm --output main.js```

## Running

Open index.html in your browser

## Develop

Ensure you have https://nodejs.org/en/ installed.

Run the following to initialise the project

```npm install```

To run a watch run the following;

```npm run watch```

Updating the Github pages site is currently a manual process (lazy I know!) copy the relevant files into the docs folder.
